# Playground Dir

You can use this playground directory to have an app to test your components when developing them.

All folders except `/example` should be ignored by version control. Here's how to set it up:

1. Copy `/example` to your own folder. You can name it whatever you want

2. On the root of this project run 
   
```shell 
yarn playground
```

3. In your browser go to `http://localhost:3000/playground/FOLDER_NAME`
